Overview of the Project

Project: Simple Calculator


Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as advanced operations like power, modulus, square root, and factorial. The calculator also maintains a history of calculations performed, providing users with an easy way to review past operations.


Key Activities:

User Input Handling:
Prompting users for numeric inputs and validating them.
Providing options for various arithmetic and mathematical operations.

Operations Implementation:
Implementing basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Implementing advanced operations (power, modulus, square root, factorial).
Handling edge cases such as division by zero and invalid input.

Calculation History Management:
Storing each calculation in a list for later retrieval.
Providing functionality to display the history of calculations to the user.

User Experience Enhancements:
Asking users if they wish to perform another calculation.
Handling invalid operation choices gracefully.


Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Java
Development Tools:Visual Studio Code for coding.
